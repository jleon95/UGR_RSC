# Networks and Complex Systems

Compilation of reports (in Spanish) as the main goal of this course isn't coding but knowledge extraction.

The topics covered are the following:

* Part 1: basic network analysis and drawing of whatever Facebook network you can get your hands on.

* Part 2: random networks and some of their properties.

* Part 3: Pathfinder networks (time complexity and parameters) and drawing algorithms.

* Part 4: a study of coautorships in Network Theory (as compiled by Mark Newman in 2006), using several measures and drawing algorithms in order to derive relevant information about that particular scientific community.
